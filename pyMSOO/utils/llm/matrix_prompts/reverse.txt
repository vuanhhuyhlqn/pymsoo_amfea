I am using MFEA algorithm to optimize some different tasks. From the strategy below, help me generate an reversed strategy that has 4 guide lines to create a RMP (Random Mating Probability) matrix using the following information:
- 'task_count': The number of tasks.
- 'pop_mean': A matrix of shape (task_count, indi_len), where each row represents the mean vector of the population for each task. It describes the average position of individuals in the search space per task.
- 'pop_variance': A matrix of shape (task_count, indi_len), where each row represents the per-dimension variance of individuals in the population of each task. It describes the spread or diversity within each task.
Strategy: {0}
The reversed strategy must:
- Oppose the reasoning or behavior in the original strategy
- Shift priorities or thresholds in the opposite direction
- Not be trivially reworded; the logic must be meaningfully reversed
- Still be coherent and potentially useful under different population states
Each guide line should:
- Use these statistics to assess **the similarity or difference between tasks** in terms of distribution in the search space.
- Propose how RMP values between task pairs should be adjusted accordingly.
- Be logically sound, non-trivial, and varied in perspective or criteria.
- Avoid overly simple rules or generic statements.
Output must be a valid JSON object with the following format: {{ "strategy": [ "guide line 1", "guide line 2", "guide line 3", "guide line 4" ] }}. Do not number the guide lines. Follow the format and do not give any further explain.
